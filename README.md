# Adonis API application

This is the API for a web application "WeSpeak" I am working on. It is basically a language learning app that helps one learn the basics of the Tyab(Kataf) language as well as many other endangered languages. I plan to support many languages from Kaduna, Nigeria, and far beyond.

Please you can support and contribute to this project. contact me here +2348035542225 or  davidshemang@gmail.com

## Setup

Clone the repo and use `npm install` to get the API set.



### Migrations

Run the following command to run startup migrations.

```js
adonis migration:run
```
run `adonis serve` to get the API running locally on port 3333
